#If you want to detect relationships between nucleotides in a DNA sequence
#It creates a neural network model with a training data using the tensorflow library and uses this model to predict the relationships between the nucleotides contained within the dna variable. 
# The model is trained with the previous data and then used with the test data to make predictions. 
# Predictions are classified and returned with the sigmoid activation function, which is often used in classification problems.
